# ETC5543_RRSCalcu
This repo was made as a requirement for Monash's ETC5543  internship unit. Contains all SQL scripts and R code used in IQVIA's data linkage and Rx-risk score project.

This project investigates the longitudinal patient journey of nearly all Australian patients, understanding their comorbidities and prescription history to compute a prescription risk score that could in turn also help to predict future hospitalisations. It was conducted by IQVIA and NostraData to help the Australian healthcare system to reduce the load on hospitals and healthcare workers so they can better and more safely deal with load posed by COVID 19.
